Throughout our journey together, you’ve probably realized that genetics data are enormous and complicated. Today, we’re going to explore two other characteristics that researchers usually encounter in Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS): 

- Genetic data are correlated

- Genetic data are sparse

We will also touch on some ethic issues that arise while carrying out GWAS research. This lesson will help you explore each of these two topics one by one. Click on the section of interest on the menu bar to get started!
